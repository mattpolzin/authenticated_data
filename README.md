Playing with authenticated data structures

Started with http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/gpads.pdf and seeing what falls out in Idris 2.

Playing with this definitely led me in the direction of [Authenticated computations as a library](https://github.com/ekmett/auth/blob/master/src/Control/Monad/Auth.hs), which uses monad composition. Getting things to scale how I want them to within the Idris 2 type system has remained an interesting challenge.
